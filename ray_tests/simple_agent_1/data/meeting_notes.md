# Meeting Notes - Teal Agents Ray Testing

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Topic:** Agent Testing with Local Plugins

## Attendees
- Development Team
- QA Team

## Agenda

1. **Review MCP Integration**
   - Unit tests completed (27/27 passing)
   - Integration tests in progress
   - OAuth2 flow tested with mocks

2. **Create Ray Tests**
   - Build actual working agents for end-to-end testing
   - Start with local plugins (FilePlugin)
   - Later expand to MCP servers

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests: Mock-based, fast, isolated
   - Ray tests: Real agents, real plugins, real LLM calls
   - Focus on user perspective

## Action Items

- [x] Create simple_agent_1 with FilePlugin
- [ ] Test agent locally with sample data
- [ ] Document usage patterns
- [ ] Expand to MCP-based agents

## Notes

The FilePlugin demonstrates the basic plugin architecture:
- Inherits from BasePlugin
- Uses @kernel_function decorators
- Returns structured Pydantic models
- Handles errors gracefully

This pattern will be the foundation for more complex agents with MCP integration.
