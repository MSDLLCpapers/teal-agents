Welcome to the File Assistant Demo!

This is a sample text file that demonstrates the file reading capabilities
of the agent.

The File Assistant can:
1. List all files in the data directory
2. Read the contents of any file
3. Search for files using patterns

You can ask questions like:
- "What files are available?"
- "Read the contents of sample.txt"
- "Show me all JSON files"
- "What's in the notes file?"

This agent uses a custom FilePlugin to access and read local files,
demonstrating the plugin architecture of the Teal Agents framework.
