**1. Title**  
**Transition of WBP2608 from Clinical Phase to Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) Phase at MFG1 Facility**

---

**2. Change Description**  
This change transitions the manufacture of WBP2608, a novel recombinant human hyaluronidase (client product code: ALT B4), from the clinical/GMP batch production phase to the Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) phase in the MFG1 facility at WuXi Biologics to support commercial manufacturing readiness. The change includes execution of PPQ protocols and associated plans, updates to master batch records and bills of materials, confirmation of facility, utility, and equipment validation states, as well as risk assessment and control strategy implementation for materials and methods to ensure readiness for commercial supply.

---

**3. Current State**  
WBP2608 is manufactured in MFG1 and has undergone GMP batch production (clinical phase).

---

**4. Proposed State**  
WBP2608 will execute Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) in MFG1 to qualify the process and associated controls for commercial manufacturing.

---

**5. Rationale/Justification**  
The transition to the PPQ phase is required as part of the client’s commercialization plan for WBP2608. The execution of PPQ is essential for confirming that the manufacturing process, facility, utilities, equipment, methods, and materials meet regulatory and client requirements for commercial production. Facility, utilities, and equipment in MFG1 are confirmed in the validated state per the Facility Validation Master Plan (WXMS-FVMP-MFG1-2023), and the latest validation summary (WXMS-FVSR-MFG1-2022). All systems are maintained in validated state through periodic qualification and preventive maintenance (PM) per SOPs (e.g., WX-SOP-00461, WX-SOP-01177, WX-SOP-01277).  
Key process equipment has been installed and qualified; capability assessments will be performed before PPQ, and details will be documented in the PPQ protocol and reports. All required process validation and cleaning validation protocols will be generated and approved prior to execution per SOPs (e.g., WX-SOP-00458 for process validation and WX-SOP-00459 for cleaning validation).  
Laboratory methods for raw material, in-process, and release/stability testing will be validated and approved prior to use (see Analytical Method Validation Master Plan, WX-PRT-10391). Materials will be released per WX-SOP-00429 and qualified per WX-SOP-00451, with TSE/BSE certificates checked. Risk assessments for materials (including excipients) will be conducted following Article 46(f) of 2001/83/EC and applicable SOPs.  
Computerized systems are validated and have no impact from this change control. All protocols and master batch records (MBRs) will be created/updated and approved prior to use. Training of personnel will be completed prior to the execution of new protocols and operation of new MBRs as per WX-SOP-00419.  
There is no impact to other sites, and regulatory assessment for market submission is the responsibility of the client.

**6. Product Impact Assessment and Explanation**

**Product Impact:**  
*Yes, this is a product impacting change.*

**Detailed Rationale:**

Based on the WI-4592 Appendix 2 “Change Classification Tool” and SOP-3200:

- The transition from a clinical phase/GMP batch process to PPQ is a significant change that “potentially affects product Critical Quality Attributes (CQA), Critical Process Parameters (CPP), manufacturing controls, analytical standards, process validation, method validation, materials, and batch records.”
- The change scope involves new/updated process validation protocols, cleaning validation, method validations, update of batch records/BOMs, and risk assessment of raw materials and excipients.
- “Does the change 'POTENTIALLY' affect… any product Critical Quality Attribute (CQA)?” YES—PPQ is specifically to confirm robustness and consistency of product/process and is a prerequisite to commercial registration/release.
- “Does the change introduce… new material to commercial manufacturing?” YES—a commercial process and associated controls/materials are being established/qualified.
- “Does the change ‘potentially’ affect… process validation, analytical method validation, and control strategies?” YES—the change includes method validation, establishment/approval of new process descriptions, MBRs, and other control documentation.

**References:**
- WI-4592, Appendix 2: If ‘Yes’ to any questions regarding CPP, CQA, process validation, etc., the change is classified as Product Impacting.
- SOP-3200 Section 4, Appendix 2: “Transition to a commercial PPQ phase requires full impact assessment and controls for all systems.”
- QRG-078 Table 1 and Appendix 1: Introduction or qualification of a new process phase for commercial manufacturing is always Product Impacting.

| **Rationale/Justification** | The transition to the PPQ phase is required as part of the client’s commercialization plan for WBP2608. The execution of PPQ is essential for confirming that the manufacturing process, facility, utilities, equipment, methods, and materials meet regulatory and client requirements for commercial production. All relevant systems, methods, and materials are qualified or will be requalified and controlled per site and regulatory standards. All documentation, validations, and personnel training will be completed and approved before PPQ execution. No impact to other sites or IT/computerized systems. Regulatory notification/submission is the client's responsibility. |
| **Product Impact**       | Yes, product impacting. The change introduces commercial process validation, potentially affects product CQAs and CPPs, updates batch records and methods, and introduces or qualifies materials and documentation for commercial supply, per WI-4592 and SOP-3200.
