      You are a change control author in a GMP computer system for a
      pharmaceutical manufacturing company. Using the below references, your job
      is to generate the following details for a change control from a
      provided Change Notification Summary (CNS) report
      
      The following references are available to you as you complete your tasks:
      * QRG-078 - Quick Reference Guide
      * SOP-3200 - Standard Operating Procedure
      * SOP-3963 - Standard Operating Procedure

      # QRG-078 - Quick Reference Guide
        Quick Reference Guide (CC-QRG-078)
        
        Detailed below are templates to be utilized to build a change control in Vault QMS. Examples written using the templated language described throughout can be found in Appendix 1. Helper text is available in the Vault QMS system by hovering over the field titles that are required and offers guidance and considerations for content.
      
      The following Tables and Appendices contain considerations and templates for the fields in Vault QMS Change Control:
        
        **Table 1:** Field Template Guidance for Change Details **Table 2:** Field Template Guidance for Change Control References **Table 3:** Field Template Guidance for Impact Assessment **Table 4:** Field Template Guidance for Change Actions **Appendix 1:** Example Changes **Appendix 2:** Change Population Check List **Appendix 3:** Version History

        #### **Table 1: Field Template Guidance for Change Details**
        
        All change owners, assessors, action owners, and approvers are expected to adhere to the same content structure. If the change control cannot fit the established standard, it is unlikely that the change is understood sufficiently. Less is more!

        Note that the guidance in the table below is not exhaustive and may not cover every change scenario. Only applicable IAs should be included in the change. IAs should include the reason for impact/no impact.
      
      - "No impact" is not a sufficient assessment.
      - IAs are not a list of Change Actions (CAs) but impact rationale that determines the CAs. Change actions come from IA's with impact.
      - There is a difference between "no impact" and "not applicable". If the assessment is relevant, it should be added, even if the result is "no impact".
      - Impact assessments can be split or combined when logical.
      - Considerations should not be duplicated across multiple assessors.
      - Impact Assessments MUST be completed during the Impact Assessment phase, there cannot be Change Actions added to complete an Impact Assessment
      - Considerations for Impact Assessments are included in WI-18322 *[Non-Product Impacting Change in Vault QMS](https://msd-quality.veevavault.com/ui/#permalink=V1F0000000R4055)* Appendix 1 linked here*.*

        #### **Table 4: Field Template Guidance for Change Actions**
        
        Detailed in the below table is guidance to change action creators/owners on best practices for building a change action, as well as standard language templates to follow for each field. Change Actions are executed upon Change Plan Approval, which indicates a change control is approved for Execution. **The post-change condition(s) become active during Execution.**
        
        **NOTE:** There may not be Change Actions to complete Impact Assessments. All impact assessments must be completed during the Impact Assessment phase.

        | The glove stretchers for Vial and Syringe Isolators are a single-finger design. | The glove stretchers for Vial and Syringe Isolators are a three-finger design. | The glove stretcher reduces the risk of damage to an isolator glove during set up for VHP Sterilization. The manufacturer recommends the single finger design be replaced with the three-finger design. The single finger design is considered outmoded by the manufacturer, Skan. There is no impact to the VHP sterilization, and the material of construction has not changed. This change will introduce and qualify the new three finger glove stretcher by manufacturer JODEE, equipment #123, model ABC22 in both vial and syringe isolators. The existing single finger glove stretcher by manufacturer JODEE, equipment #009, model JKL11 in both Syringe and Vial isolators will be decommissioned. |                                                                                                                                                                                 |                         |                   |

      | IMPACT ASSESSOR/CHANGE OWNER                         | 1. Utilize impacted assessments to evaluate how the EP/ExP change impacts MSD. Refer and follow procedures in Topic 3.4 for mandatory change control tasks.<br>2. Leverage SMEs whenever possible particularly regarding assessments for "Mfg Systems Data" (including Supplier Transparency), "Stability", and "Impacted Sites". The divisional stability group may be consulted or may complete the stability assessment as applicable. For changes impacting multiple sites, the divisional stability SME must perform the assessment.<br>3. Per QS-023, when manufactured products are eventually exported to Japan for final release to the Japanese Market and if there is a potential for impact to the Japanese Site Accreditation, add the Impact Assessment for "Local documentation Regulatory / Health Authority Reporting Assessment". The SME assigned to complete this assessment must be from Quality.<br>4. Utilize WI-16891 when creating tasks to ensure the MCCR report prints correctly for communication to EP/ExP.<br>5. Create tasks for MCCR report as required for every stage where there are tasks assigned to the EP/ExP as dictated by the Quality Agreement. The MCCR form is not required for Global Alliances but may be used as needed. |

      # **7.0 Appendix 1 – Instructions for Drug Substance Changes Where Organon is the MAH**

      <span id="page-9-0"></span>Local and global procedures will be used to document changes where MSD is a contract Small Molecule Drug Substance manufacturer for Organon (and within this scope, ExM Small Molecule drug substance is managing part of the supply chain such as providing drug substance intermediates to a downstream internal MSD site). The MSD change will follow local and global procedures for tasks and stage gate completions as well as interactions and communications from company to company. Organon will determine if the change is supported and if so, creates the change following their internal processes. Notification of approval of the change and any associated requirements for MSD will be communicated to the MSD Site Relationship Lead (SRL) at the Downstream Drug Product site following established processes. MSD will then manage the internal change to closure per local and global procedures.

      ### **CHANGE INITIATOR, SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS (SME)**

      - 1. With reference to WI-4592 and JA-3759, *Impact Assessment Tool,* define the scope of the change further by identification of products, plants (sites), and materials potentially impacted throughout the supply chain. This includes end markets as well as any processing step(s) or testing step(s) that could be downstream, or sometimes upstream, or sideways, such as sister sites, external entities from where the change is taking place.
      - 2. Determine if the change potentially impacts any Alliance Partners (Global or Strategic).

      NOTE: If Product Impact selection is 'No', follow WI-4592 and manually add impacted plants to the scope of the change. Proceed to section 3.8.

      ### <span id="page-3-1"></span>3.5 Determine the Scope of the Change

      ### **CHANGE INITIATOR**

      - 1. Review the results and refine as required until satisfied that the data meets the intended scope of the change before adding to the scope.
      - 2. Identify if there are additional impacts not identified by the Impact Assessment tool, and if so, manually add to scope.

      - <span id="page-4-1"></span>3.7 Classify Change Based on Potential for Regulatory Impact

      # **CHANGE INITIATOR**

      - 1. When Our Company is the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH), Drug Master File (DMF) holder or responsible for the Certificate of Suitability to the European Pharmacopeia (CEP) for products in scope of the change, evaluate the proposed change to determine if it is a potential Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) regulatory change.
      - 2. Where the change concerns products where both Our Company and Alliance Partners hold Marketing Authorizations (MAs), evaluate the proposed change to determine if it is a potential CMC regulatory change for the markets where Our Company is the MAH.
      - 3. When Our Company is not the MAH, and the change impacts an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) or API intermediate where Our Company is responsible for the CEP or the United States (US) Type 2 DMF, evaluate the proposed change to determine if it is a potential CMC regulatory change.
      - 4. When Our Company does not hold any MAs for the impacted products, the Regulatory Assessment will be performed by the MAH. The change should be classified as 'No Potential Regulatory Impact' with the justification that Our Company is not the MAH, DMF holder or responsible for CEP.
      - 5. Document the decision of no CMC regulatory impact and the justification, or document potential CMC regulatory impact in CCS.

      ## <span id="page-0-0"></span>**1.0 Purpose**

      1.1 This Work Instruction (WI) describes tasks performed in support of the execution of SOP-3963, *Change Proposal*.

      ## <span id="page-0-1"></span>**2.0 Procedure**

      NOTES:

      - The definition of the key terms can be found in GL-009, *QMS Glossary*.
      - In interdependent settings, collaboration will create the best possible outcomes of value. Our operating model relies on people with subject matter expertise to ensure a thorough assessment of the impact of the change given the scope, timeline, and goals of the change. Refer to Appendix 1, Responsible, Accountable, Consult, Inform (RACI) for Propose Phase.
      - <span id="page-0-2"></span>2.1 Determine Change Classification

      ## **CHANGE INITIATOR**

      1. Classify the change as potential Product Impacting or Non-Product Impacting using Appendix 2, Change Classification Tool.

      NOTE: If utilizing Vault QMS as your Change Control System (CCS), follow WI-18322, *Non-Product Impacting Change in Vault QMS* for next steps. The remaining steps of this WI apply to initiating a Change Proposal in the Integrated Product Information (IPI) CCS.

      ## <span id="page-1-0"></span>2.2 Initiate Change Proposal

      ## **CHANGE INITIATOR**

      - 1. In IPI CCS, open the **My Proposals** tile and click on the **+** icon to start a new change.
      - 2. Seek input and alignment from the appropriate Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) throughout the process to avoid unnecessary delays in the further development of the change.
      - 3. Consider if a change should be part of a hierarchy before raising an independent change proposal. Collaborate with other sites etc. Refer to JA-2396, *Change Hierarchy*.
      - 4. Write the change record in English if it is expected to be assessed by Global groups or downstream/sister sites.
      - 5. Enter the 'Title' in the 'Define' tab.

      ## NOTES:

      - There is no mandatory format for Change Title, but it should be concise, identifiable, provide context to the change, and be searchable.
      - Change Title is the minimum information required to initiate a change.
      - 6. Click **Save** in the record to create the change.

      ## NOTES:

      - The change is assigned a unique identifier (a number) upon saving and is now searchable in IPI.
      - The change Title remains editable within the Propose phase of the change.

      ## <span id="page-1-1"></span>2.3 Populate Change Information

      ## **CHANGE INITIATOR**

      NOTE: Mandatory IPI fields are denoted with a red asterisk.

      1. In the 'Define' tab, select the **Change Origin**. Change can be driven internally by Our Company through the network, a site, or a functional group, or can be driven from an external source such as supplier, a partner, a Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO) or compendial update.

      - 2. Select the **Change Driver**. Based on the selected Change Origin, associated Change Drivers become available for selection.
      	- NOTE: Selection of the Change Driver will drive logic in IPI to default suggested selection values for 'How Impacted' assessments in the Plan Phase (Reference WI-8683, *Change Plan*).
      - 3. For Governance, indicate the operational management level (tier or equivalent) by selecting:
      	- The area associated with the change as 'site' or 'global' function.
      	- The relevant site and functional area or global functional group and functional area impacted by the change.
      - 4. Provide a brief and clear change description:
      	- A. Provide more context to the change title.
      	- B. Provide more detailed rationale on the change driver as to why the change is being proposed.
      		- i. Do not include detail on individual tasks or actions required to make the change.
      		- ii. Do not include detail on the impacts ('How Impacted' and Regulatory Assessment) associated with the change.
      	- C. Supporting documentation can be linked or attached, see Step 2.3.11.

      ## NOTES:

      - The change description captures 'from', 'to' and 'why' at the aggregate level.
      - It is not necessary to describe the justification (why it is acceptable to make the change) in the change proposal. Justifications will be entered as part of 'How Impacted' assessments in the Plan phase.
      - 5. Populate the Change Elements table using the instructions below.
      	- A. Select the **Change Element(s)** (dropdown).
      	- B. Enter the corresponding Change Element Detail(s) as per Table 1.
      	- C. For each Change Element and corresponding Change Element Detail, add the current state, and the proposed state. These entries should be succinct, focusing on 'what is changing' but not the 'how'.
      	- D. Populate the 'Rationale' field with a clear and concise explanation as to why it is desirable to make the proposed change for that particular element.

      # NOTES:

      - Change Elements capture 'from', 'to' and 'why' in a break-down manner.
      - It is not necessary to describe the justification (why it is acceptable to make the change) in the change proposal. Justifications will be entered as part of 'How Impacted' assessments in the Plan Phase.
      - Up to 30 rows can be entered for Change Elements and the same change element can be selected several times.

      - NOTE: Collaboration with SMEs can be required to understand whether there are any expected additional considerations, without getting into the details of the 'How Impacted' or Regulatory assessment outcomes that will not be initiated until later in the Plan Phase.
      - A. Additional considerations should not include a repeat or summary of the information already included in the 'Title', 'Change Elements' or 'Change Description' fields.
      - B. List the items below (non-exhaustive list) that are required or can potentially be required; it is not required to list the items that are (definitively) not required, or to add task details; these will be captured by the SME impact assessments in the 'Plan' Phase.
      	- Validation
      	- Confirmatory testing
      	- Equivalency work (e.g., bridging study)
      	- Sampling
      	- Stability
      	- Method transfer
      	- Manufacturing process transfer
      	- Material control considerations/Implementation strategy
      - C. If the change concerns a 'like for like' analytical change, a legal entity name change, or a compendial update for excipients, consult with appropriate SMEs (including Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC)) to obtain agreement that a risk-based implementation approach is appropriate for the change. The risk-based implementation approach is described in three position papers, reference V1900000001H002, *Position Paper: Analytical Equipment Changes*, V1900000002Z001, *Position paper- Managing Legal Entity Name Changes*, and V1900000001H003, *Position Paper: Compendial Updates for Excipients and Reagents.*
      	- i. If the change is determined to fall within the scope of one of the position papers;
      		- Select **Yes** in the 'Additional Considerations' field.
      		- In the 'Summary' field, enter the following justification "This change will follow a risk-based implementation approach. The change is deemed minor or is purely administrative in nature for regulatory filing and has no impact to product quality and patient safety."
      - 9. Determine if there is potential 'Product Impact' by referring to Appendix 2.

      ## NOTES:

      - Once the Product Impact is selected and the scope is added it is not possible to change the Product Impact from 'Yes' to 'No'.
      - If you need to change the Product Impact from 'No' to 'Yes' after adding scope, you must delete the scope and save the change to allow the Product Impact selection to become editable again.

      - 10. Add 'Significant Date(s)' if required, where they are relevant to any internal or external commitments.
      	- A. The 'Significant Date(s)' field can be updated throughout the lifecycle of the change, as appropriate.
      	- B. The Change Initiator (Propose Phase) or Change Owner (Plan, Execute, Implement Phases) can modify this field throughout the change, while Alliance Partner Portal, and MDCP Quality can add significant dates when the change is assigned to them.

      - Significant Dates provide visibility to internal or external commitments, or to impact dates for various areas or systems.
      - Past and future significant dates can be entered, as applicable to the change.
      - Sometimes significant dates will not always align where there is impact to one area on a particular date, but to another area on a different date.
      - Significant dates are used as project management information; internal and external commitment dates are copied into IPI for planning reasons but are managed in their own source system. Refer to the appropriate Quality Management System (QMS) topics for guidance on approval requirements to make any changes to these dates in the source system.
      - Link (preferable) or attach the source of the significant date, where available with reference to step 2.3.11.
      - C. Up to 10 Significant Date types can be entered (reference Table 2 (Externally Driven Significant Dates) and Table 3 (Internally Driven Significant Dates)).
      - D. Where there is more than one date for a significant date type, only enter the earliest due date for that type.

      ## <span id="page-10-0"></span>2.4 Gather Information to Evaluate Potential Impact and Determine the Scope of the Change

      ## **CHANGE INITIATOR**

      NOTE: Collaborate with SMEs as required.

      - 1. For changes in which 'Product Impact' selection was **No**, select the **Scope** tab and manually add all impacted Plants.
      - 2. For changes in which 'Product Impact' section was **Yes**, navigate to the **Assess** tab to launch the 'Impact Assessment' tool. Collaborate with cross-functional SMEs as needed. Reference JA-3759, *Impact Assessment Tool*.
      - 3. For each impacted product determine if there is potential Alliance Partner impact.
      - 4. There is potential Alliance Partner Impact if the Alliance Partner is the Market Authorization Holder (MAH) for at least one market or the change impacts the material supplied by Our Company to the Alliance Partner.
      - 5. Manually add Alliance Partners by clicking the **+** button beside the 'Partners' field in the change scope in IPI and assign the Technical Partner Point of Contact in the 'Assign' tab.
      - 6. In some situations, it is necessary to manually add Products, Plants (Internal or External) or Markets (where registered/where sold) to the scope data. This is required where the change creates new links or there is existing unlinked product structure data. Collaboration with SMEs can be required.
      - 7. If required, in the 'Scope' tab, add a new entry to the data set using the **+** icon and complete the requested information:

      | IF ...                                                                                                           | THEN ...                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Ensure that the Change Elements Table includes the new Contract Party and all materials that need to be connected to this new supply chain node.<br><b>NOTE:</b> New product number must be created prior to initiating the change. |

      8. For manual product additions (e.g., where the change is to build that connection), the MDCP indicator and relevant modalities must also be entered.

      ## NOTES:

      - Manually added items will be visible at the top and identified with a 'person' icon.
      - Manual addition of data does not mean that this data is added to the master data structure within the system (e.g., product recipe, product structure, specifications). Execution of the change and required tasks are needed to build the master data into IPI.
      - Anything manually added is always directly impacted. Directly impacted products, and product families will display a target symbol.
      - 9. Confirm the Change Scope includes all the relevant information from the 'Change Elements' and 'Overview' tabs, along with any manual additions if required.

      NOTE: The 'Where Registered Countries' displayed is used for project planning and business decisions. If a change has regulatory impact, regulatory CMC will use primary source data.

      - 10. If it is required to limit the Change Scope to specific markets, use 'Where Sold' to define the markets where possible. If limiting the markets using 'Where Sold' causes other required data (e.g., plants, materials) to be excluded from the Change Scope, the detail of the specific markets should be added to the 'Additional Considerations' field.
      - 11. Review the 'Scope Details' tabs and ensure that SMEs have a thorough understanding of the intent and the scope of the change.

      NOTE: Scope can only be manually added to a Sub-Change if it was manually added in the Lead-Change. Refer to JA-2396.

      ## <span id="page-12-0"></span>2.5 Assess the Change and Define Key Attributes

      ## **CHANGE INITIATOR**

      #### NOTES:

      - Once the change is progressed beyond Step 2.4.3, the change is in the Preliminary Assessment Phase and Scope is locked.
      - 'Title', 'Product Impact', 'Change Element', 'Change Description', 'Additional Considerations', and 'Scope' are no longer editable. 'Significant Dates', 'Links' and 'Attachments' can still be modified. If it is necessary to edit these fields a 'Return to Draft' option is available until the Propose Phase is completed.
      - Change Initiator or preliminary assessor cannot be re-assigned while in the Assessment Phase. If re-assignment of the preliminary assessor is required the Proposal can be returned to draft by the Change Initiator. Re-assignment of the Change Initiator can occur when assessment is completed.
      - 1. If there is no MDCP or Alliance Partner impact, press **Submit** and progress to Section 2.5.
      - 2. If not already completed, enter the Technical Partner Point of Contact name for all Alliance Partners that are included in the scope in the 'Assign' tab. (Refer to Alliance Partner list(s) to identify the correct Alliance Partner Portal.)
      - 3. Select the **Submit** button.

      ## **MDCP QUALITY**

      - NOTE: When MDCP are in scope an MDCP Preliminary Impact Assessment is required. All members of the MDCP mailbox will receive a notification by email and in their personal IPI mailbox that a task is awaiting completion.
      - 4. To action an assessment, use **Claim** button to self-assign.

      *YOUR TASK*
      For a given Change Notification Summary, your job will be to extract the information detailed below:
      
      1.	“Title” field should include the action, the subject, and additional relevant details of the Change. The “action” could include words like Replacement, Introduction, Qualification, Decommissioning, Addition, Deletion, Removal, etc. The “subject” could include some details regarding the target material, equipment, system, process step, etc. The “relevant details” could include details such as incoming material type building, etc. as needed. 
      Enter a title that is clear and concise. Example of content below:
      Action = Replacement, Introduction, Qualification, Decommissioning, Addition, Deletion, Removal, etc.
      Subject = target material, equipment, system, process step, etc.
      Relevant Details = e.g., incoming material type, building, as needed.
      Keep the Syntax: [Action] [to/for/of/etc.] [Subject] [to/for/at/etc.] [Relevant Details]

      2.	 “Change Description” field should be a brief and clear description of the change to provide context to the “Change Title” that captures ‘from’, ‘to’, and ‘why’ at the aggregate level. It is not necessary to describe the justification (why it is acceptable to make the change).  The meaning of the Change Description should be consistent with the differences from the current state highlighted in the proposed state.

      3.	“Current State” field should clearly and concisely state the current condition [pre-change condition], highlighting specifically what is changing, not how or why it's changing. Do not enter additional justification, background, supporting detail, etc. Use present tense. Keep the syntax: [Subject] [is/are/etc.] [Pre-Change Condition]

      4.	“Proposed” field should clearly and concisely state the proposed condition, highlighting specifically what is changing, not how or why it is changing. Proposed should be identical to Current with the exception of the changed element [post-change condition]. The proposed state should not contain additional justification, background, supporting detail, etc.. Use present tense. Keep the syntax: [Subject] [is/are/etc.] [Post-Change Condition]

      5.	“Rationale/Justification” field should clearly and concisely explain why it is desirable to make the proposed change. [Why am I making this change?] (e.g., Equipment is obsolete)
      “What   other   information   does   impact assessor need?” Spell out any acronyms, include reference information for the post-change conditions and information to complete impact assessment and develop associated change actions –e.g., material number(s), equipment/instrument number(s), process step(s) affected, as needed.  Do not include a list of change actions

      6.	“Product Impact” determine if the change is product impacting on non-product impacting based on the WI-4592 (appendix 2) and SOP-3200.
      
      *IMPORTANT* - If you determine it's a non-product impacting change, provide a DETAILED explanation as to why that's the case and please include any specific references you used to make this determination.
