Based on the current state of this project and assuming that changes will be made to
achieve the baseline state described in `04-01-hitl-baseline.md`, create a set of tasks
which, when completed will introduce the functionality described in `04-02-hitl.md`.
Save this implementation plan in to a new file called
`04-03-hitl-implementation-plan-claude.md` in the `planning/2507-state-hitl-auth` directory.
