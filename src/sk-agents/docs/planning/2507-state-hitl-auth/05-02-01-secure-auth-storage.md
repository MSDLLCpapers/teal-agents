# Secure Auth Storage Service Requirement
This is the first step in this phase 5 introduction of authorization in to the agent
platform. We will introduce an abstraction for the "Secure Auth Storage Service" that
enable the agent platform to store and retrieve tool authorization information.

For an overview of the scope of phase 5, see
@planning/2507-state-hitl-auth/05-01-auth-infra-overview.md.

## Requirements
* Introduce a new abstract class `SecureAuthStorageManager` that defines the interface
  for storing and retrieving tool authorization information for a given user and tool.
  We are targeting only OAuth 2.0, presently, but when designing the interface, it
  should be flexible enough to accommodate other authorization mechanisms in the future.
* For OAuth 2.0 implementation type, tokens should be reusable for any tool that
  leverages the same authorization server and scopes.
* Implement a concrete class `InMemorySecureAuthStorageManager` that implements the
  `SecureAuthStorageManager` interface and stores the authorization information in
  memory.
* Introduce a factor class that will return an appropriate singleton instance of the
  configured `SecureAuthStorageManager` implementation as defined in the environment
  variables:
    * `TA_SECURE_AUTH_STORAGE_MANAGER_MODULE` - The module path to the
      `SecureAuthStorageManager` implementation.
    * `TA_SECURE_AUTH_STORAGE_MANAGER_CLASS` - The class name of the
      `SecureAuthStorageManager` implementation.
