We are planning work a few weeks out for changes that need to be made to this workspace.
Context about the work which is not yet completed is available in the following files:

* @planning/2507-state-hitl-auth/01-02-state-refactor-implementation-plan.md
* @planning/2507-state-hitl-auth/02-02-manual-tool-call-implementation-plan.md
* @planning/2507-state-hitl-auth/02-03-hitl-implementation-plan.md

If helpful, there are additional files in the `planning/2507-state-hitl-auth` directory
which can provide more context on the changes detailed in the above files.

Create a set of tasks which, when completed, will introduce the functionality described
in @planning/2507-state-hitl-auth/04-01-tool-catalog.md and save this set of tasks to a
file called `04-02-tool-catalog-implementation-plan.md` in
`planning/2507-state-hitl-auth` directory.
