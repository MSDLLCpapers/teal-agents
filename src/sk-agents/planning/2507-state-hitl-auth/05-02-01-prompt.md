We are planning phase 5 of future work to extend this agent platform, which introduces
user/tool-specific authorization capability. For an overview of all phase 5 work and
relevant background, see 05-01-auth-infra-overview.md (as well as any referenced
sources).

The scope of this first step in phase 5 is defined in 05-02-01-secure-auth-storage.md.

Create a new file at
planning/2507-state-hitl-auth/05-02-02-secure-auth-storage-implementation-plan.md which
provides a detailed implementation plan for this first step.

Notes:
* I prefer pydantic BaseModel classes over dataclasses
